  Pumpkin Pancakes:

  * 2 cups all-purpose flour
  * 2 Tbsp granulated sugar
  * 2 tsp ground cinnamon
  * 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice
  * 2 tsp baking powder
  * ½ tsp baking soda
  * ½ tsp salt
  * 1 ½ cups buttermilk

directions_markdown: >-
  1. Heat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. If using a griddle,
  set it to 350°F (175°C).

  2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

  3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, pumpkin puree, melted and cooled unsalted butter, and the large egg.

  4. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.

  5. Allow the batter to rest for about 10 minutes. This helps the ingredients meld, improves the texture of the pancakes, and helps to create fluffier pancakes.

  6. Lightly grease the griddle or pan with butter or non-stick cooking spray.

  7. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for each pancake. Use the back of a spoon to spread the batter into a round shape if needed.

  8. Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges look set, about 3-4 minutes. Flip the pancakes with a spatula and cook the other side until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. Remove the pancakes from the griddle or pan and keep warm.

  9. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.

  10. Place the diced apples into a small saucepan. Add in cinnamon, and ¼ cup of water. Let the apples come to a boil, then cover for 5 minutes. Remove the lid and cook until the apples are tender.

  11. Serve the pancakes warm with yogurt, nuts, and the cooked apples.

  12. Now, enjoy!
