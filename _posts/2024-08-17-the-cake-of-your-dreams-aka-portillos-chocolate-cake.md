  1. Preheat the oven to 350F and prep 2 9″ cake pans and a cupcake pan. Grease
  the inside and line the bottom with parchment paper. If you have them, wrap
  the pans in damp cake strips and set aside.

  2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. 

  3. In a measuring glass, add the milk and stir in the vinegar and vanilla. Set aside.

  4. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugars, oil, and mayo, followed by the eggs and egg yolk. 

  5. Mix in the milk mixture. 

  6. Pour in half of the dry ingredients and whisk to combine. 

  7. Pour in the hot coffee and whisk to combine, followed by the remaining dry ingredients. The batter should be very thin and liquid. Evenly distribute the batter between the two pans. There should be enough batter left to make four cupcakes. 

  8. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick in the center comes out clean with a few moist crumbs.

  9. Allow the cakes to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edges and turn out onto a cooling rack. Cool the cakes completely before frosting, either at room temperature or in the refrigerator.

  10. To make the frosting, place a saucepan or pot over a medium heat and add in heavy cream. Heat until you start to see little bubbles forming around the edges of the pan. The cream shouldn't be boiling. Turn the heat down to low and add in the remaining ingredients and continue to gently whisk until all the solid ingredients are melted and you have a very smooth mixture.

  11. Pour the mixture into a heat proof bowl, and then cover the top with cling wrap so that the cling wrap is directly touching the top of the frosting. This will prevent a skin from forming as it cools down.

  12. Place the frosting into the fridge for 2 hours to allow it to set.

  13. Before assembling, make sure the cake layers are completely cooled.

  14. Level off the top of each cake layer if needed.

  15. Lay one layer down on a cake turntable and spread a layer of frosting on top. Lay the next cake layer on top, repeating the process.

  16. Once all the layers are stacked, place the cake in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes to allow those layers to set. Once set, cover the entire outside of the cake with frosting.

  17. Now, enjoy! 


  Notes:


  The original recipe found here uses 3 8” pans. The infamous Portillo's chocolate cake uses 2 9” cake pans and I wanted to replicate the cake as best as I could. However, using 2 9” pans leaves some remaining batter to make around 4 cupcakes. If you decide to use 3 8” pans, bake for 30 - 35 minutes instead.  


  If you end up leaving your frosting in the fridge for too long and it's very hard, then either let it come to room temperature, or if you're in a rush, heat the frosting in the microwave for 10 second bursts at a time, mixing in between each burst until you reach your desired consistency. On the other hand, if your frosting is still too soft, just leave it in the fridge for longer to firm up.
