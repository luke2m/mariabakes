  Rhubarb Strawberry Jam

  * 2 cups sliced strawberries (from about 12 ounces whole strawberries)
  * 1 ½ cups sliced rhubarb (from 3-4 medium stalks)
  * 1 cup granulated sugar (7 ounces)
  * 2 tablespoons lemon juice (see note)
  * Pinch table salt
directions_markdown: >-
  1. Place a plate in the freezer to chill. Add the strawberries, rhubarb,
  sugar, lemon juice, and salt to a large saucepan. Use a wooden spoon or rubber
  spatula to stir everything together.

  2. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is bubbling vigorously all over, around 5 minutes.

  3. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring often, until the berries soften and break down and the mixture thickens, about 15 minutes. (The jam will still look very liquidy at this point, but will thicken up as it cools down.)

  4. Turn off the stove and slide the saucepan to a cool burner. Remove the plate from the freezer. Carefully spoon a small amount of jam onto the chilled plate (the jam will be very hot!). Return the plate to the freezer for 2 minutes.

  5. Remove the plate from the freezer and drag your finger through the jam. If your finger leaves a distinct trail that doesn’t close up, the jam is done! If the jam is still runny and the trail closes up quickly, return the saucepan to medium-low heat and cook the jam for a few more minutes, then repeat the test.

  6. Let the jam cool in the saucepan for 5 minutes. 

  7. Transfer the jam into a jar or bowl (both will be hot!). Let the jam cool completely on the counter, about 45 minutes.

  8. Serve, or cover the jam and transfer it to the refrigerator.
