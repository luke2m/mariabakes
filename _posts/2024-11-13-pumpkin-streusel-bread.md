  Streusel:


  1. In a medium bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients: flour, light or dark brown sugar, cinnamon, and kosher salt. Pour in the melted butter and stir until just combined and crumbly. Set in the fridge to chill while you make the pumpkin bread.


  Pumpkin Bread: 


  1. Preheat the oven to 350 and grease a 9×5 loaf pan, then line with a piece of parchment. It should be long enough that it sticks up along the long sides of the loaf pan so you can lift the pumpkin bread out later.

  2. In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin puree, vegetable oil, brown sugar, and granulated sugar. Once combined, whisk in 2 large eggs one at a time.

  3. Sprinkle baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt over the pumpkin mixture and whisk to combine thoroughly. Repeat with the ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, ground ginger and pinch of ground cloves. Finally, fold in the all-purpose flour until fully combined (but don't overmix to prevent overdeveloping the gluten).

  4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the streusel over the top. Place pan on a baking sheet in case of overflow and place on the middle rack (remove the rack above if needed–this bread will rise a good amount!).

  5. Bake 65-80 min or until an inserted tester comes out clean (a few crumbs are okay). Mine usually takes closer to 80 minutes. If the top is browning too fast, cover loosely with foil.

  6. Let cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes. Let cool completely, before removing from the pan.


  Maple Spiced Glaze:


  1. Optionally whisk together the confectioners sugar, melted butter, maple syrup, and ground cinnamon to make a smooth glaze. Add milk as needed to adjust the consistency. 

  2. Drizzle over the cooled loaf.

  3. Now, enjoy!

Super, moist and tender, this pumpkin streusel bread reminds me of the Costco loaf breads sold in their bakery. They sell a lemon blueberry loaf and a cinnamon coffee cake loaf. My ABSOLUTE favorite part is the streusel on top. It’s so crunchy and sweet! The maple glaze ties the whole thing together. This pumpkin bread is just SO good! This bread makes the house smell amazing. A mix of cozy spice, pumpkin, and maple syrup!
